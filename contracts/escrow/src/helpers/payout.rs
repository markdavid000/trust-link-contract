/// Computes the protocol fee for `amount` at `fee_bps` basis points.

/// # Rounding policy: floor (round toward zero)
///
/// The fee is `floor(amount * fee_bps / 10_000)`. Integer division truncates,
/// so any sub-stroop remainder is dropped from the fee. Crucially, callers
/// derive the payout as `net = amount - fee` (see [`calculate_protocol_fee`]),
/// which means the truncated remainder is **not** lost — it stays in `net` and
/// is paid to the recipient (seller on release, buyer on refund). The contract
/// only ever retains exactly `fee`, which is later swept by the admin via
/// `withdraw_fees`. The invariant `net + fee == amount` therefore always holds
/// and no stroop is ever stranded in the vault.
///
/// Consequence of flooring: for amounts where `amount * fee_bps < 10_000` the
/// fee rounds down to `0` and is effectively waived. The `MIN_ESCROW_AMOUNT`
/// guard (1_000_000 stroops) in `create_escrow` keeps escrows large enough that
/// a non-zero `fee_bps` always yields a meaningful, non-zero fee.
///
/// Floor is chosen deliberately over ceiling/round-half-up: it guarantees the
/// contract never owes more than it custodies and never over-collects fees at
/// the recipient's expense.
///
/// The computation is split (`amount / 10_000 * fee_bps` plus the remainder
/// term) to avoid overflowing `i128` for large amounts.
